# Personal-Web-Site---Building-Blocks
This is for a website that I'm developing from the bottom up. 

The purpose is to add code as I learn. My hope is that I can incorporate not only robust features, but doing so implementing best practices.

I'm new here to GitHub, so I'm hoping this process is helpful in building community as well.
